- Hi, I’m @RicardoQuiroga :^)
- I'm interested in software design, music, videography, and getting to learn about the world & new people!
- I'm currently endulging the more artsy side of my brain (I have an album coming out this year!!), so programming side projects have come to a hiatus...
- ...
- If only somebody could hire me into a software engineering position so that I could do that as well :D
- Email me at quirogarickyj@gmail.com for any inquiries!
